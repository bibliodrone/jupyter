# Jupyter Notebook 

## Overview 

This repo is home of my various projects created in notebook. I made the repo mainly to work between 3 of my computers to practice good develpment habits. Each notebook (or set of notebooks) is stored in a seperate folder.  Information on the creation of the virtual enviorment is contained in each folder.
