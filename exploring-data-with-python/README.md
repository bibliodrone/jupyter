# Exploring Data With Python
Exploring Data With Python is an in-depth look at examining categorical and quantitative data. Data generally can be divided into these two different types. This series of notebooks are designed to present a bitesize approach to inspecting and evaluating raw data using proven statistical best practices. 

### Educational Goals

1. Become a data explorer (develop a passion for discovering the information hidden inside of data)
2. Improve mathematical skills through applications of proven statistical practices
3. Introduction to various python libraries used to perform statistical analysis (Beginner level)
4. Introduction to various tools for data visualization.
5. Build on goals 2 and 3 to provide include more advanced.

### Topics Covered

### Python Libraries Included

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib

### Future ideas
1. Split the notebooks so they can become a series of short presentations (less than 20 minutes)
2. Add more advanced statistical concepts
3. Incorporate LaTex and more detailed information about the underlying mathematical theorems.
